### 3.6.2 
* Fixed some bugs related to the status of the panel in HomeKit when the alarm is triggered


### 3.6.1 Beta 4 
* When pushing statuses to HomeKit, the panels target state is now sent before the current state to hopefully help with the activity history


### 3.6.1 Beta 3 
* Added another log to help identify why the panel is going Unknown when disarmed by the keypad


### 3.6.1 Beta 2 
* Fixed panel still showing up as Triggered


### 3.6.2 Beta 1 
* (Hopefully 🤞) fixed a bug causing legacy contact and motion sensors not to be recognized


### 3.6.1 Beta 1 
* Added option for panel to not show as triggered during the entry delay


### 3.6.0 
This is a long-overdue update and I’ll do my best to recap it
* First, a major rewrite of how device statuses are fetched
  * They are now synchronous by default, allowing for HomeKit to always display the latest status when opened
    * This behavior can be reverted by enabling 'Lazy Updates' - but I only recommend this if homebridge is frequently logging that 'This plugin was slow to respond' (typically caused by having a lot of devices or a slow network)
  * Accessories are now properly reported as offline, as opposed to previously where the plugin would crash
  * Fixed a lot of bugs that would cause the plugin to simply hang and not respond at all
* Secondly, I did go ahead and add some donate links
  * On that note, if you had an issue open and I never got back to you, please add another comment. I acknowledge that I kind of dropped the ball on this plugin for the past several months, but I’ll do my best to respond to new comments for issues still applicable after this update.

Thank you all for your continued use of this plugin!
